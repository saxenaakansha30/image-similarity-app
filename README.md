# Image Similarity Tool (using CLIP + FAISS)

This is a small project where I built a simple image similarity search tool using two open-source libraries: **CLIP** (by OpenAI) and **FAISS** (by Meta).

You can:

- Upload images to build an index
- Search for similar images by uploading a new image
- Or search by entering a text query

The app is built with **Streamlit** for quick testing and demo purposes.
